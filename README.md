### A functioning democracy requires an engaged citizenry.

Our stakeholder, [Demand Progress](https://demandprogress.org/) is focused on Internet Freedom, Open Government and Financial Reform. In order to hold government accountable they must keep track of shifting legislative schedules and content.

It is difficult to follow when Congress has scheduled a committee/subcommittee hearing/meeting without a paid subscription to a news service that gathers this info.

The Senate and House release meeting notices online in structured data formats, but thereâ€™s no well-designed publicly-available central place to see all the notices from the different committees or subcommittees.

The Demand Progress team will build a user-friendly web based calendar for congressional hearings and markups. With one click users will be able to add these events to their own calendar. If time allows we will have a couple other stretch goals requested by our stakeholder including a tool for converting PDF's of pre-introduction legislation to plain text and/or a tool for parsing organizational sign-on lists for letters of support.
